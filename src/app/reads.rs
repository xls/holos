//! Reading a directory, and knowing whose answer is whose.
//!
//! Every directory read carries a **generation**, generations are monotone per
//! tab, and an answer whose generation is not the tab's current one is dropped
//! rather than drawn, so walking quickly through four directories cannot end
//! with the third one's rows under the fourth one's path.
//!
//! The generation answers what is *drawn*. What is *produced* is answered by
//! [`App::register_read`]: a tab has one live read at a time, and starting one
//! aborts the task still streaming the last one. Both halves are needed - a
//! batch already in flight when the tab moved on has to be dropped by
//! generation, and a walk over a million-entry directory that nobody is
//! waiting for any more has to stop rather than run to completion filling a
//! channel whose rows are all discarded.
//!
//! A read is queued and never performed here.
//! [`crate::input::dispatch`] touches no filesystem, so navigating pushes a
//! [`ReadRequest`] and the event loop turns it into a stream of
//! [`VfsEvent`]s.
//!
//! # The thread that draws never blocks on I/O
//!
//! The event loop is also the render thread: it services these queues and then
//! calls `term.terminal().draw()`. So "not in `dispatch`" is only half the
//! rule. Anything that can wait on a disk, an archive or a socket has to
//! happen on the blocking pool and come back through a channel, or a panel
//! pointed at a hung mount takes the whole application down with it - no key
//! read, no frame drawn, no way out.
//!
//! [`Vfs::capabilities_for`] is one of those: on an archive path it opens the
//! archive to learn the format, and on a remote one it can wait on the
//! transport. So the completed listing hands back a [`CapsRequest`] instead of
//! asking, [`probe_capabilities`] answers it off this thread, and the tab
//! carries its backend's conservative answer until the real one arrives -
//! which is the same fill-in-later behaviour the rows themselves have.
//!
//! A re-read keeps the cursor, the marks and the quick-search buffer and
//! replaces the rows only when the new ones arrive, so refreshing costs a
//! directory read and disturbs nothing the user was in the middle of.

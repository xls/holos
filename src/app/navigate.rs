//! `Enter` on a row: going into whatever it turns out to be.
//!
//! A path segment is pushed **optimistically** when a container is entered.
//! `bundle.zip` is a directory as far as the panel is concerned, and whether
//! it really is one is not known until a backend has tried to read it, so the
//! panel goes there first and the first listing decides. If it proves not to
//! be a container the panel is returned to exactly where it was, which is what
//! [`crate::app::ContainerAttempt`] remembers and what makes `Enter` on a
//! damaged archive a message rather than an empty directory nobody can leave.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a file: [`crate::input::dispatch`] may not, so `Enter`
//! queues an [`crate::app::OpenRequest`] or a read and the event loop resolves
//! it.

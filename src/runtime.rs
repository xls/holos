//! The asynchronous half of the application: the event loop, and every task it
//! spawns.
//!
//! This is the layer between `dispatch`, which may touch neither the
//! filesystem nor the terminal, and the work a keystroke asks for. It owns the
//! channels - reads, jobs, console output, the viewer's line index, a connect
//! attempt's questions - the tasks on the other end of them, and the
//! generation checks that decide which of their answers still count.
//!
//! It lives in the library rather than in `src/main.rs` because that is what
//! makes it reachable: cancellation, channel ordering and the `select!` are
//! the parts most likely to be wrong, and a test cannot drive what only the
//! binary can see. `tests/runtime_loop.rs` drives the step functions below
//! with channels of its own. The binary keeps argument parsing, terminal
//! setup and teardown, and calls [`event_loop`].

//!
//! Recorded here and in
//!
//! * `panel.human_sizes` - the design says **false**; the example file says
//!   `true`. The reference screenshot shows `362,333`, not `362 K`. Default is
//!   `false`.
//! * `panel.thousands_separator` - the design says **true**; the example file
//!   omits it entirely. Default is `true`.
//! * `panel.attr_style` - the design defines it (`"unix"` default, `"dos"`
//!   alternative); the example file omits it. Default is `Unix`.
//! * `panel.dir_brackets` - the design defines it as `true`; the example file
//!   omits it. Default is `true`.
//! * `panel.date_format` - the design renders `2026-08-12 02:40` and gives the
//!   `date` column `min_chars = 16`, which only fits that form. The example
//!   file says `"%d-%m-%y %H:%M"`. Default is `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`.
//! * `viewer.highlight.engine` - the example file says `"tree-sitter"`, but
//!   the design settle on `syntect`. Default is `Syntect`, and
//!   `"tree-sitter"` is accepted as a deprecated alias that raises a warning.

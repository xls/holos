//! `keymap.toml`.
//!
//! Shape: `[global]` / `[panel]` / `[cmdline]` / `[viewer]` / `[dialog]` /
//! `[console]` tables of `action_id = ["binding", "fallback"]`. Every list entry
//! is a binding for the same action; the second is usually the legacy-terminal
//! fallback.
//!
//! # Resolution order
//!
//! 1. Context-specific binding from `keymap.toml`.
//! 2. Global binding from `keymap.toml`.
//! 3. Built-in default for the context.
//! 4. Fall through to the context's default text handling - quick search for a
//!    panel, insert for the command line.
//!
//! The four steps are four real tables, consulted in that order: the user's
//! context table, the user's `[global]` table, the built-in context table, and
//! the built-in `[global]` table. [`Keymap::builtin`] fills the built-in layer
//! with the full compiled-in Total Commander layout; a user file goes into the
//! layer above it. Step 4 is what [`Resolution::Unbound`] tells the caller.
//!
//! Keeping the two layers apart is what makes step 2 outrank step 3, and that
//! is not a detail: a hand-written `[global] hotlist = ["backspace"]` has to win
//! over the built-in `[panel] parent = ["backspace"]`, or the user's own file is
//! silently dead. Collapsing the layers gives the reverse of the specified
//! order.
//!
//! **Layering rule.** When a user file mentions an action, that action's
//! built-in bindings *in the same table* are removed first, then the user's list
//! is installed. So `quit = ["ctrl+q"]` really means "quit is `Ctrl+Q` and
//! nothing else", which is what someone hand-editing a keymap expects. Actions
//! the file does not mention keep their defaults, so a partial file is useful.

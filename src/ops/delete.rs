//! Delete, to the trash and permanently.
//!
//! the design settles the split: **`F8` trashes, `Shift+F8` unlinks**. Both
//! arrive here as a [`JobKind::Delete`] whose `trash` flag says which, so the
//! progress dialog, the cancellation path and the failure summary are the same
//! code for both.
//!
//! > Directories are recursed with a single confirmation, not one per entry.
//!
//! The confirmation is the dialog's business - [`confirm_lines`] is the text it
//! should use, so the count named in the prompt and the count the runner acts
//! on cannot drift apart. What this file guarantees is the other half: one job
//! walks the whole selection and never stops to ask.
//!
//! # The three rules this file exists to keep
//!
//! 1. **Contents before their directory, always.** The unlink is an explicit
//!    post-order walk rather than one `remove_dir_all`, so a cancelled delete
//!    leaves a tree that is *smaller* and never one that lost a directory whose
//!    children are still on disk. There is no intermediate state in which an
//!    entry is unreachable but present.
//! 2. **Cancellation is checked between every entry**, so `Esc` over a
//!    half-million-file tree stops in milliseconds rather than at the end.
//! 3. **A failure never aborts the batch**. It also never
//!    cascades: a directory whose child could not be removed is skipped
//!    silently rather than reported a second time as "not empty", because the
//!    real error has already been named.
//!
//! # Nothing shells out
//!
//! "Nothing shells out". The XDG trash is reached through the
//! `trash` crate, which implements the freedesktop.org spec in
//! process - the `.Trash/files` and `.Trash/info` pair, the `trashinfo`
//! records, and the per-mount `.Trash-$uid` fallback. There is no `gio trash`
//! and no `rm`.
//!
//! # When there is no trash to move to
//!
//! A read-only mount, or one where `.Trash-$uid` cannot be created, has nowhere
//! for `F8` to put anything. The crate says so; this file surfaces that message
//! **verbatim** and marks the failure with [`NO_TRASH_HERE`] so the UI can
//! offer a permanent delete ([`permanent_delete_offer`]). What it never does is
//! quietly unlink instead - `F8` and `Shift+F8` are different keys because they
//! are different decisions, and silently promoting one to the other would make
//! the safe key the destructive one.

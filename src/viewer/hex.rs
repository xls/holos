//!
//! There is no decoding here and no index: a hex row's byte range is
//! arithmetic, which is why hex mode works identically on a file whose index
//! has not started. Everything in this module is a pure function of an offset
//! and a width.
//!
//! # The three things this module is careful about
//!
//! * **Both bases.** the design asks for offsets "in both hex and decimal".
//!   The cursor's offset is shown in both in the status line, always. The
//!   *per-row* offset column shows the decimal half **only when the terminal
//!   has room for it after the bytes and the gutter** - [`HexPlan`] decides,
//!   once per frame, so the answer cannot change from row to row. Two full
//!   offset columns cost 12-22 of an 80-column terminal, and the bytes are what
//!   the mode is for.
//! * **The last row is short.** A file rarely ends on a row boundary. The hex
//!   column pads with blanks so the gutter stays where the eye left it, and the
//!   ASCII gutter renders *only the bytes that exist* - no `.` for a byte that
//!   is not there.
//! * **A row that does not fit is cropped, never wrapped.** `viewer.hex_width`
//!   is the user's, and 64 bytes per row needs 220 columns. A row wider than
//!   the terminal loses its right-hand end rather than folding onto the next
//!   line and doubling every row's height. [`HexPlan::row`] does the cropping,
//!   so it is one place and it is testable without a terminal.
//!
//! # Binary files
//!
//! "A file detected as binary opens in hex automatically unless
//! overridden." The detection itself lives in [`super::decode::looks_binary`]
//! (a NUL byte in the first 8 KiB, or more than 5% odd C0 controls, with a
//! two-byte-unit encoding excused because UTF-16 is half NULs and is text); the
//! *consequence* is [`initial_mode`] here.

// > right.
//
// The switch itself is one field on the viewer and one enum here
// ([`super::select::HexSide`]); what makes the two sides *different* is the
// unit one press moves by, and that is the geometry below. The bytes side moves
// a whole column, so a selection made there is word-aligned by construction;
// the characters side moves one character of the active encoding, which under a
// multi-byte encoding may be several bytes and may therefore stop half way
// through a word. Both are pure functions of an offset, a configuration and -
// for the characters side - the window the caller already read.

/// Where byte `index` of a row is written in [`value_column`]'s output, as a
/// **character** range.
///
/// The one mapping from a byte to the characters that byte is drawn as, at any
/// grouping, format and byte order. It is what lets a match, and a selection,
/// be painted in the right place without the renderer doing arithmetic of its
/// own: "three characters per byte" is right only at `group = 8`.
///
/// * `format = hex`: the byte's own two digits inside its word's cell,
///   **honouring `endian`**. A little-endian word writes byte 0 last, so byte
///   0's digits are the cell's last two. That is what makes the design's
///   "partly-covered columns partly highlighted" exact rather than approximate.
/// * `format = unsigned | signed`: a decimal cell has no digits belonging to
///   individual bytes, so the whole cell comes back and a partial cover paints
///   the cell whole. A value cannot be half-printed for a word only half held.
///
/// `None` when `index` is past `width`.
///
/// # The last row of a file
///
/// A cell's character position does not depend on `width` at all, only on the
/// grouping; `width` decides which cells are *whole*. [`value_column`] writes a
/// column it has only some of the bytes for as those bytes' own digits in file

//! The `F1` help view.
//!
//! Every page is **generated from the active keymap**, never written by hand:
//! "A user who rebinds `Ctrl+D` sees their binding, not the shipped default.
//! Any hand-maintained key list is wrong the moment someone edits
//! `keymap.toml`; generating it is also less work."
//!
//! # One document, several sections
//!
//! the design lists "further pages" and, in the same breath, "the help view
//! uses the same viewer machinery, so quick find (`F7`, `/`) works in it.
//! Searching the keyboard reference for `rename` is the fastest path to
//! `Shift+F6` and `Ctrl+M`."
//!
//! A [`crate::viewer::Viewer`] is one buffer. A page-turning UI over several
//! buffers would mean either a find that searches only the page you are on -
//! which contradicts that sentence - or new viewer machinery the design does not
//! describe. So this is **one document with headed sections**, and
//! [`HelpTopic`] resolves to the line a section starts on.
//!
//!
//! # What is generated and could not have been written
//!
//! * The `Ctrl+<n>` block is built from `panel.columns.order`, so it reads
//!   `Ctrl+3  Sort by Size` only where size is the third column
//!   (invariant I14).
//! * Undeliverable bindings are marked and their fallback shown beside them
//!   (invariant I15). `Ctrl+H` in particular: on a
//!   legacy terminal the page shows it as unavailable and shows `Alt+.` in its
//!   place. All of that lives in [`crate::config::Keymap::describe`], so this
//!   module and the menu cannot spell a key two ways.
//! * Which group an action belongs in is read off the keymap's context tables
//!   rather than written down, so an action rebound from `[panel]` into
//!   `[global]` moves on the page by itself.

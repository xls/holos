//! consumes all input, and a viewer sharing the screen with two panels would
//! show three lines of a file.
//!
//! Everything drawn here comes out of [`crate::viewer::Viewer::rows`], which
//! the event loop refreshed before this frame - see
//! [`crate::app::App::service_viewer`]. **This module never reads the file.**
//! It has `&App`, and reading is the model's job; that split is what keeps
//! the memory rule checkable in one place.
//!
//! Colours are the `viewer.*` and `syn.*` slots, quantized for the
//! session's depth like everything else. No syntect theme is ever loaded.

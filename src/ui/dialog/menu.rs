//!
//! ```text
//!  Files  Mark  Commands  Net  Show  Configuration
//! +-------------------------------------------+
//! | View the file under the cursor         F3 |
//! | Edit the file under the cursor         F4 |
//! | Copy the selection to the other panel  F5 |
//! +-------------------------------------------+
//! ```
//!
//! # Every row is generated, so no row can go stale
//!
//! > Every item on it is a key that already exists, and the menu **shows that
//! > key** beside the item. That is the menu's real job here: a file manager

//! > second, weaker interface to maintain.
//!
//! So a [`MenuItem`] cannot be built without an [`crate::input::Action`]: its
//! `keys` are read from the **live** keymap through
//! [`crate::config::Keymap::describe`] and its label from
//! [`crate::input::Action::description`], which is the same string the `F1`
//! reference prints. A user who rebinds `F5` sees their own binding, and a
//! row whose wording is edited is edited in one place.
//!
//! The `Show` menu goes further and is named from `panel.columns.order`, so
//! `Sort by Size  Ctrl+3` appears only where size is the third column.
//! That is the same generation rule the page
//! follows and the reason neither can drift.
//!
//! > If an item has no key, it is because it has not been built yet, and that
//! > is a bug in the menu rather than a design.
//!
//! That sentence is a test - `every_item_has_a_key_and_is_implemented` below,
//! which is the invariant I11 - and not a comment.
//!
//! # It is a dialog
//!
//! > `Esc` closes it and gives the panel back. The menu takes focus while it
//! > is open, so the "the viewer consumes all input" applies to it too.
//!
//! That is exactly what [`crate::dialog::Dialog`] is, so this is one: the
//! focus save and restore, consume-all-input, `Esc`, the theming and the
//! mnemonic census all come for free, and the `Alt`+letter rule becomes
//! the rule with no second implementation.
//!
//!
//! # Where the box lands
//!
//! The dialog draws the six titles across the first row of its own interior, a
//! `├──┤` rule under them, and the open menu's rows filling the full width
//! below - so the box's own border frames the rows and no space is left empty
//! beside them. It asks for exactly the room those use: the wider of the bar
//! and the open menu's longest row across, and a row for the bar, a row for the
//! rule and the menu's rows down (see [`MenuDialog::size_hint`]). It
//! is a bar, so it belongs where a bar lives - it declares
//! [`crate::dialog::Dialog::top_left`] and the framework pins it to the
//! screen's top-left rather than [`crate::dialog::centred`]. That is the whole
//! reason it is not centred: the box's width and height track the open menu,
//! and a centred box would shift on every `Left`/`Right`; pinned to the corner,
//! only its far edges move and the titles stay put. It sits one row below where
//! [`crate::ui::draw_menubar`] draws `ui.show_menubar`'s permanent bar, the row
//! the box's own frame takes. That permanent bar is a different surface: this
//! one is the bar that has focus, and both carry the same six titles from the
//! same [`crate::ui::MENUBAR`] so the two cannot disagree.
//!
//! # Colour and glyphs
//!
//! No new theme slot. The open title and the
//! selected row are [`DialogStyle::row_cursor`], which is the panel's cursor
//! bar, and the dropdown's frame is the dialog border. Its two glyphs - the
//! box and the scroll arrows - both have ASCII forms under `ui.ascii_borders`
//! and both come from [`crate::ui::text::Glyphs`], so there is one place to
//! audit.

//! Rendering and theming.
//!
//! [`draw`] paints every row of the layout diagram, in order: the menu bar, the
//! two panel boxes - each with its volume line, tab bar, path and filter line,
//! column header, entries, rule and status line - the command line, and the key
//! bar.
//!
//! Two rules from the design shape this module:
//!
//! * **Both cursors are always visible**. Only one hardware
//!   cursor exists, so it goes to the focused region ([`hardware_cursor`]) and
//!   the other is painted into the buffer. Neither ever disappears.
//! * **Below 60x15 there is one message, not a broken layout**.
//!   At exactly 60x15 the whole layout renders, so every rectangle built here
//!   is checked for zero width or height before anything is written into it.
//!
//! Colours are declared by the theme in RGB against semantic slots and
//! *quantized* here for the session's depth; file-type colouring
//! is a separate, rule-based concern and lives in [`filetype`].
//!
//! The v0.2 operation dialogs - the copy/move, progress, conflict,
//! queue and summary boxes - are in [`dialog`]. They implement the framework's
//! [`crate::dialog::Dialog`] trait and are drawn by [`draw`] like any other
//! dialog on the stack; they live here because they are painting, and because
//! everything they draw that is not a `dialog.*` slot is a progress bar.

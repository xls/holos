//! The input model.
//!
//! the design calls normative and says it is the part most likely to be got
//! wrong by analogy with mc. Two behaviours are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **Typing navigates.** A printable key with a panel focused goes to the
//!    quick-search buffer, never to the command line - and the *first*
//!    character typed is already part of the buffer, so `tho` lands on
//!    `thorin` with the `t` included. There is no activation key and no
//!    timeout.
//! 2. **The command line is a focus target**, reached with `Left`/`Right` and
//!    left with `Up`/`Down`, with a caret that persists across the round trip.
//!    `Ctrl+Enter` inserts at that caret and never moves focus.
//!
//! [`dispatch`] is the single entry point. It must remain callable with **no
//! terminal attached**: it never touches stdout, never asks the terminal for its
//! size, and never reads the filesystem. A directory read is *requested* - see
//! [`crate::app::App::request_read`] - and serviced by the event loop, so a
//! headless test can push synthetic key events through and assert on state.
//!
//! # The keys that are ambiguous, and how they are resolved
//!
//! | Key | Resolution |
//! |---|---|
//! | `Backspace` | pops the quick-search buffer while one is running; goes to the parent directory otherwise |
//! | `Space` | extends a running quick-search buffer; toggles the mark otherwise |
//! | `Insert` | always marks and moves down, whatever the buffer holds; toggles overwrite on the command line |
//! | `0`-`9` | feed the buffer like any other character, unless `panel.digit_keys = "tabs"` |
//! | `Esc` | clears the buffer; clears the marks when the buffer is already empty |
//! | `Ctrl+W` | closes a tab with a panel focused, kills a word on the command line - by context, not by a special case |
//! | `Ctrl+H` | toggles hidden files under the enhanced keyboard protocol; is *Backspace* without it |
//!
//! # with a live shell, the command line is the shell's
//!
//! From v0.3 the row at the foot of the panel view **is the shell's own input
//! line**, so the twelve line-editing actions stop being implemented here and
//! start being forwarded to the PTY as bytes - see `console_key`, which is the
//! whole of the rule, and [`Action::belongs_to_the_shell`], which is the whole
//! of the list. Everything else is unchanged: `F5` still copies, `Ctrl+Enter`
//! still inserts a filename, and `Up`/`Down` still leave for the panel.
//!
//! [`CommandLine`] is not deleted by this. It is what the command line *is*
//! whenever no shell is running - a headless [`App`], a shell that would not
//! start, a shell that has died - and [`crate::app::App::console_owns_cmdline`]
//! is the single question that decides between the two. Every test in
//! `tests/input_model.rs` drives the headless side of it, unchanged.

//! What a dialog's answer means.
//!
//! A dialog consumes all input while it is on the stack, and it is handed a
//! key and nothing else: it has no `&mut App` and no way to act. So an answer
//! travels out as a [`DialogResult`] and lands here, in one `match` on the
//! [`DialogId`], which is why adding a dialog is adding an id and an arm
//! rather than string handling spread across the tree.
//!
//! # Answering is not the same as leaving
//!
//! the design ask their questions through a channel the connect
//! task is waiting on, and dropping that channel is a refusal. Every way out
//! of such a dialog other than answering therefore has to drop it, which is
//! why the accept path pops with
//! [`crate::app::App::pop_answered_dialog`] and every other path does not.

//! the design - the shell's directory and the active panel's, kept in step.

//!
//! Both halves are *decisions*, and this module is where they are taken. It
//! holds no `App`, does no I/O beyond one `stat`/`opendir` of the directory the
//! shell named, and writes nothing: [`CwdSync::panel_moved`] returns the bytes
//! for the caller to queue and [`CwdSync::shell_reported`] returns the move for
//! the caller to make. That is what makes every rule below assertable without a
//! PTY, a terminal or a filesystem.
//!
//! # The loop that must not form
//!
//! The two halves feed each other. A panel change writes a `cd`; the `cd`
//! produces a prompt; the prompt emits an `OSC 7` naming the directory we just
//! asked for. Treated as news, that `OSC 7` would move the panel - and by the
//! time it lands the user may have walked on, so it would drag them *back*.
//! Walking into a directory and straight out again is enough to see it.
//!
//! **Comparing paths is not enough**, because the echo is late: when the second
//! `cd` has already been written, the first one's `OSC 7` still names somewhere
//! the panel is not, and it is still not news. So the `cd`s written and not yet
//! answered are **counted** ([`CwdSync::unanswered`]): every `cd` produces
//! exactly one prompt, an `OSC 7` arriving while the count is non-zero is our
//! own echo and is consumed, and only one arriving at zero is the user's own
//! `cd` typed into the shell.
//!
//! # Declining is a feature
//!
//! Most of the outcomes on each side do nothing at all, and each of them is a
//! rule rather than an oversight:
//!
//! * [`Cd::Remote`] - the shell's last `OSC 7` named another host, so it is
//!   inside `ssh` (or anything else that puts a shell from another machine on
//!   the far end of this PTY). A local path means nothing there, and `cd`ing a
//!   remote shell into the local panel's directory is a change nobody asked
//!   for. It resumes the moment a local `OSC 7` arrives.
//! * [`Cd::Unknown`] - the shell does not say where its input line begins
//!   (no `OSC 133 ; B`: `dash`, `fish` without the snippet, a user who set
//!   `console.inject_hooks = false`). "Cannot tell" is not "the line is empty",
//!   and a `cd` written over a half-typed command corrupts it. The panel → shell
//!   half simply does not run, **silently**: a shell that never marks its prompt
//!   would otherwise produce a complaint at every prompt for as long as the
//!   session lasts.
//! * [`Cd::AlreadyThere`] / [`Follow::AlreadyThere`] - the shell is already
//!   where the panel is, or the panel is already where the shell is. Neither is
//!   a change, so neither is a `cd` and neither is a re-read: the design's
//!   directory read is not free, and one per prompt would be a spinner that
//!   never stops.
//! * [`Follow::Unreadable`] - the shell is somewhere the panel cannot list. It
//!   says so and stays where it is; navigating would blank the panel and then
//!   report the failure, which is a hole where a directory used to be. A shell
//!   only needs `+x` on a directory to sit in it, and a panel needs `+r` to list
//!   it, so this is an ordinary Tuesday and not a corner case.

//! The ten v0.4 acceptance criteria, and the nine that
//! the cursor and selection brought with them, driven through the
//! real `hcmd` binary.
//!
//! The `selection_*` tests at the foot of the file are the second set. They use
//! one thing the first ten do not: [`Session::raw`] as a *clipboard*. An
//! `OSC 52` sequence is written **to** the terminal and never lands in a cell,
//! so the only place a copy can be seen from outside is the byte stream itself.
//!
//! Same shape as `tests/acceptance.rs`, `acceptance_ops.rs` and
//! `acceptance_console.rs`: a `portable-pty` pseudo-terminal, real key bytes
//! written into it, a `vt100` parser on the way back, and assertions on the
//! rendered cells. Nothing here inspects the library - the milestone's claim is
//! about what `F3` puts on a terminal, so that is what is read.
//!
//! Four things about this harness the other three do not need:
//!
//! * **The viewer owns the whole screen**, so its geometry
//!   is fixed and simple: row 0 is the title, the last row is the key bar, the
//!   status line sits above it, and everything between is the file.
//!   [`Session::title_row`], [`Session::status_row`], [`Session::keybar_text`]
//!   and [`Session::body`] are that layout, and they are
//!   what makes "the top of the window did not move" an assertion rather than a
//!   guess.
//! * **Colours are read per cell, by column.** Criterion 2 is about a *mapping* -
//!   syntect's scopes onto the `syn.*` slots - and the only way to
//!   see a mapping from outside is to read the foreground of the cell a keyword
//!   landed in. [`Session::row_cells`] rebuilds a row from its cells rather than
//!   from `contents()`, so a character's index in the string really is its
//!   column.
//! * **Criterion 2 runs the same file under two themes.** A keyword painted
//!   `#FF54FF` under `blue` and `#FF79C6` under `dracula` is the theme's colour;
//!   a keyword painted the same under both would be syntect's own, which
//!   the design explicitly forbids ("map syntect styles onto theme slots,
//!   not onto syntect's own themes").
//! * **Criterion 9 does not wait for the screen to settle.** A 40 GB file has a
//!   background index scan repainting `indexing n%` continuously, so "unchanged
//!   for a beat" never comes true - and the criterion is a *stopwatch*, which a
//!   250 ms settle would swamp anyway. [`Session::press_timed`] polls the
//!   predicate every couple of milliseconds and returns how long it took.
//!
//! The console is switched off in every test (`[console] enabled = false`).
//! v0.3's shell is a separate milestone with its own harness, and a live `bash`
//! drawing its own prompt into the bottom rows would make "the panel came back
//! with the cursor where it was" an assertion about somebody's `PS1`.
//!
//! The child gets a throwaway `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME`, so a run
//! neither reads nor corrupts the developer's own configuration or saved tabs.

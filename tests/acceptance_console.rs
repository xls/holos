//! The v0.3 acceptance criteria, driven through the real `hcmd`
//! binary.
//!
//! Same shape as `tests/acceptance.rs` and `tests/acceptance_ops.rs`: the
//! binary is spawned on a pseudo-terminal, key bytes are written into it, and
//! every assertion is made against cells parsed back out with `vt100`. Nothing
//! here inspects the library.
//!
//! What is different, and what to know before reading a test:
//!
//! * **There is a real shell inside our PTY inside the test's PTY.** The
//!   outer one is the terminal `hcmd` draws to; the inner one is the terminal
//!   `bash` draws to, and the design says the second is rendered into the
//!   first. So a criterion about the command line is a statement about three
//!   processes agreeing, and the harness pins every variable it can:
//!   - `SHELL=/bin/bash`, so `console.shell = ""` resolves to a shell whose
//!     prompt hooks this application actually injects;
//!   - `HOME` is a throwaway directory holding a `.bashrc` that sets
//!     `PS1` to [`PROMPT`]. It has to be an rc file rather than an environment
//!     variable: an interactive `bash` overwrites an inherited `PS1` with its
//!     own default before any rc file runs, which was verified rather than
//!     assumed.
//!   - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME` are throwaway too, so a run
//!     neither reads nor corrupts the developer's configuration, saved tabs or
//!     command history.
//! * **Nothing waits on a clock.** [`Session::wait`] polls the parsed screen
//!   until it has stopped changing *and* the expected thing is on it. Every
//!   test also starts with [`Session::ready`], which waits for the shell to
//!   have run the injected snippet and drawn its first *marked*
//!   prompt - the observable proof being the `clear` the snippet ends with.
//!   Without that, a fast test could type at a prompt whose `OSC 133` marks did
//!   not exist yet, and half would be racing.
//! * **`HCMD_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL=enhanced`.** A bare pty answers no capability
//!   query, and criterion 6 needs `Ctrl+Enter`, which only the Kitty protocol
//!   can express.
//!
//! Every test skips itself where there is no `/bin/bash`: these criteria are
//! about a shell whose prompt this application knows how to mark, and a machine
//! without one is not a failing machine.

/// execution and is not in v0.3. A console session
/// the user opened with `Ctrl+O` stays open until `Ctrl+O` closes it, which is
/// what the `switch_on_run` and every prior file manager do; a
/// console that threw the panels back over the screen after every `echo` would
/// be unusable for the interactive work this criterion is about.

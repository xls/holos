Familiar function keys. A streaming viewer. Remote connections that feel like
local folders. Share over HTTP/WebDAV, send to a phone with native LocalSend.
Holos brings the classic commander workflow to a modern terminal, with tabbed
panels, background jobs and a built-in shell to keep you moving.

## Install

**Get started on Linux or macOS:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xls/holos/main/install.sh | sh
hcmd
```

Prefer Node.js?

```sh
npx holos-installer
hcmd
```

Both installers choose the build for your platform and install the latest release
to `~/.local/bin`, without root. If `hcmd` is not found, add that directory to
your `PATH`, or launch `~/.local/bin/hcmd` directly. `holos` starts it too.

**Arch Linux and Omarchy:** install it as a pacman package instead, so pacman
tracks it and `sudo pacman -R hcmd-bin` removes it. Run again to update.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xls/holos/main/install-arch.sh | sh
```

The script downloads the latest release's package, checks it against the
published `SHA256SUMS`, and installs it with `sudo pacman -U`. x86_64 only; on
arm64 use the installer above.

**Already installed?** Run either installer again to update, or use
`npx holos-installer update`.

Want a package or a manual download? Get a **.deb**, **.rpm** or **tarball** from
[Releases](https://github.com/xls/holos/releases). Linux builds are available for
glibc and musl. There is no Windows build.

<details>
<summary><strong>Installer options and download verification</strong></summary>

- `HCMD_INSTALL_DIR`: binary location, default `~/.local/bin`.
- `HCMD_SHARE_DIR`: editable themes and example configuration, default `~/.local/share/hcmd`.
- `HCMD_VERSION`: release to install, default the latest.

The installers check downloads against the release's published `SHA256SUMS`.
They warn if checksums are unavailable; the shell installer also warns if neither
`sha256sum` nor `shasum` is installed.

You can review the [shell installer](install.sh) or the
[Node.js installer](packaging/npm/install.js) before running it.

<details>
<summary><strong>Distribution packages and building from source</strong></summary>

**Debian / Ubuntu:** download the `.deb` from Releases, then run:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i hcmd_*.deb
```

**Fedora / RHEL:** download the `.rpm` from Releases, then run:

```sh
sudo rpm -i hcmd-*.rpm
```

**Arch Linux:** from a checkout of this repository:

```sh
cd packaging/arch && makepkg -si
```

**From source:** requires Rust 1.95 or newer and a C compiler for the compression
and archive libraries. With `rustup`, the repository's `rust-toolchain.toml`
selects the pinned toolchain automatically.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xls/holos
cd holos
cargo build --release
./target/release/hcmd
```

The binary is self-contained apart from libc and libstdc++.

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS tips</strong></summary>

macOS reserves `Ctrl+F1` to `Ctrl+F6` for keyboard navigation, so hcmd never sees
the column-sort keys. For the best experience, free them:

1. Open **System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Keyboard**.
2. Turn off the `Ctrl+F1` to `Ctrl+F6` entries ("Turn keyboard access on or off",
   "Move focus to the menu bar", "...to the Dock", "...to active or next window",
   "...to the window toolbar", "...to the floating window").
3. Under **Function Keys**, turn on **Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function
   keys**, so `F3` views and `F5` copies without holding `fn`.

If you would rather keep the macOS shortcuts, `Ctrl+F7` to `Ctrl+F9` still sort
by columns 2 to 4, and `Ctrl+1` to `Ctrl+9` sort by any column.

## Made for more than moving files

### Keep both sides in view

Work with your source and destination side by side. Open **up to nine tabs per
panel**, jump to bookmarked directories, and preview a file in the opposite
panel without leaving the listing.

Copy and move with familiar function keys. Queue long operations in the
background, follow their progress, and keep browsing while they run.

**Two-panel browsing.** Source and destination side by side, with tabs and familiar function keys.

[![Quick navigation](docs/hotlist.png)](docs/hotlist.png)

**Quick navigation** with Volume list | Hot list | Tabs 

### Open the archive. Skip the unpacking.

Step into **ZIP, 7z, RAR and TAR** archives as if they were folders, including
archives inside archives. Formats are detected by content, so a renamed file
is still recognised.

Explore **ISO, FAT, ext2/3/4 and SquashFS disk images**, including GPT and MBR
partitions, with read-only browsing. Find the file you need and copy it out.

Open a **SQLite database** the same way: enter it to list its tables, enter a
table to stream its rows, sort by the table's own columns, and read or copy any
row out as JSON. Read-only, and an optional build feature.

### Bring your servers into the same workflow

Connect over **SFTP, FTP, FTPS, SMB2/3, S3 or WebDAV**, then browse, view and copy
through the same panels you use locally. Saved passwords use the system keyring.

The protocols run in process, without an external `ssh` command or
`libsmbclient` installation.

[![Remote connection dialog with quick connect and saved hosts](docs/sftp-ftp-remote.png)](docs/sftp-ftp-remote.png)

**Remote connections (`Ctrl+F`).** Quick connect or choose a saved host, then browse and copy through an ordinary panel.


[![Remote connection dialog with quick connect and saved hosts](docs/serve.png)](docs/serve.png)
**Share the other way (`Ctrl+N`).** Select files or folders and hcmd serves them
over **HTTP and WebDAV** for as long as the dialog is open. A browser gets a
plain index page with names, sizes and dates; another hcmd (or Finder, Explorer,
rclone) connects to the same address as `dav://`; downloads resume. Read-only.
The dialog shows the addresses to hand out and the last requests, and - since
the host firewall is what usually stops the next machine - which firewall is on
and the command that opens the port (`serve.port`, 8080 by default). Closing
the dialog stops serving.

**Fetch a URL (`Ctrl+D`).** Download into a per-session folder (`Alt+J`) as a
background job with a progress bar; a partial file resumes.

[![Native Local send](docs/localsend.png)](docs/localsend.png)

**Send to a phone (`Alt+X`) - native LocalSend, send only.** A built-in
implementation of the [LocalSend](https://localsend.org) protocol: send the
selection to any LocalSend device on the LAN - pick it from the list or type
its address - and it lands in the stock app with its usual prompt. Runs as a
job; encrypted to the device's own certificate. hcmd sends, it does not
receive.

### Look inside files of any size

Press **F3** for a streaming viewer that starts displaying a file without waiting
to load it all into memory. Read large logs, inspect highlighted source, or view
**JSON, HTML and Markdown** in document mode.

Switch to hex for the bytes behind the file. Built-in binary templates describe
**109 formats**, exposing details such as image dimensions and executable
architecture, with the corresponding regions highlighted in hex mode.

[![Built-in viewer showing syntax highlighting and a text selection](docs/viewer-syntax-highlight-and-selection.png)](docs/viewer-syntax-highlight-and-selection.png)

**The viewer (`F3`).** Syntax highlighting, line numbers and selection details in the active theme.

[![Hex viewer showing a PNG header, byte offsets and ASCII](docs/hexviewer.png)](docs/hexviewer.png)

**Hex mode.** Inspect a file's bytes, with offsets and ASCII side by side.

### Find it. Then work with it.

Search names and content across **local folders, remote connections and archives**.
Use masks, whole-word matching or regular expressions to narrow the search.
Results become a panel you can act on while the search is still running.

[![Find Files dialog with name, content and archive search options](docs/findinfiles.png)](docs/findinfiles.png)

**Find Files (`Alt+F7`).** Search by name or content, including inside archives, and work with results as they arrive.

### See what changed in Git

Spot file status in the listing and the current branch in the status line.
Browse **commit history as folders**, open the files a commit changed, and compare
against `HEAD` or between panels with unchanged sections folded away.

Holos reads directly from the object store, without starting a `git` process.

### Make it your workspace

- **Rename in batches** with a preview and dedicated undo.
- **Verify and organise** with checksums, file splitting and merging, symlinks and permissions.
- **Drop into a persistent shell** with `Ctrl+O`, then return to your panels.
- **Find your look** with 21 built-in themes and a live preview picker (`Alt+T`).
- **Set your own shortcuts** with configurable key bindings and readable TOML settings.

### Dress it in any theme

Twenty-one built-in themes with a live-preview picker (`Alt+T`) that applies as
you move over each one. On an [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) desktop there is
one more: a dynamic `omarchy` theme that reads the desktop's own palette and
recolours in place when you switch the desktop theme.

**Themes (`Alt+T`).** Twenty-one built-in looks, plus live integration with Omarchy's colour scheme.

## Your first minute

Start `hcmd` in a directory you know, then try these:

1. **Move around:** use the arrow keys and `Enter` to browse; `Tab` switches panels.
2. **Take a look:** highlight a file and press `F3` to open the viewer.
3. **Copy across:** choose a destination in the other panel, return to your file,
   and press `F5` to open the copy dialog.
4. **Find something:** press `Alt+F7` (or `Alt+S`) to search.
5. **Make it yours:** press `Alt+T` and preview a theme.

**Need a shortcut?** `F1` shows the keyboard reference for your terminal.
**Ready to leave?** `F10` or `Alt+Q` quits.

## Configuration

On first run, Holos writes commented configuration to `~/.config/holoscommander/`.
Uncomment a setting to override its default.

- **`config.toml`**: application settings, with defaults documented.
- **`keymap.toml`**: key bindings for each context.
- **`themes/`**: your custom theme files.
- **`hotlist.toml`**: directory bookmarks (`Ctrl+D`).
- **`hosts.toml`**: saved remote connections.

All 21 themes are built into the binary. To customise one, copy its installed
file from `~/.local/share/hcmd/themes/` into `~/.config/holoscommander/themes/`
and edit it. A matching name overrides the built-in theme; new names appear
alongside the defaults in the picker.

<details>
<summary><strong>Terminal compatibility and diagnostic commands</strong></summary>

Holos uses the Kitty keyboard protocol when available, allowing combinations
such as `Ctrl+Enter`, `Shift+F1`-`F10` and `Alt+F1`-`F12` to be distinguished.
For legacy terminals, affected bindings have documented `Alt`+letter fallbacks.
Press `F1` to see the bindings your terminal can deliver.

```sh
hcmd --keytest      # show how your terminal encodes each key
hcmd --check-config # validate configuration and exit
```

Set `HCMD_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL=enhanced` or `HCMD_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL=legacy` to
override automatic detection.
